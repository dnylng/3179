        <h2>"Happiness depends upon ourselves" - Aristotle</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>World Happiness Report</strong> is an annual publication that marks the ranks
            of happiness based on the well-being of their citizens. People are asked to
            evaluate their current lives on a scale of 0 to 10, with <span style="color: lightseagreen;">10 representing the 
                best possible life</span> and <span style="color: lightcoral;">0 the worst possible life</span>. It provides a holistic view 
            of wellbeing.

            <h1>Happiness Across the Globe</h1>
            <p>Around the globe happiness levels vary extremely, therforem it is essential
                to recognise the differences in happiness scores across both different regions 
                and different sub-regions. To the right are boxplots that show the happiness levels for 
                both categories.
            </p>
            <h3>Happiness Across Regions</h3>
            <p>
                Historically, European countries often rank high in happiness scores. Oceania also fares very 
                well in terms of happiness, however there are not many countries in Oceania so the data is specific. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, African countries often rank low in happiness scores. With some parts of Asia 
                being ranked lowly as well. This can be due to a combination of many factors. It has consistenting been 
                this way for the major regions across the previous years of the world happiness report.
            </p>
            <h3>Happiness Across Sub-Regions</h3>
            <p>
                Within larger regions, subregions can show significant variations in happiness. For instance East 
                Asia might have a different distribution than those in South Asia or Southeach Asia.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Demonstrating that happiness for a region does not necessarily mean happiness for all subregions. 
                This makes it almost ignorant to just look at data from a regional perspective and instead to have a more 
                accurate representation of happiness, subregions should be considered as well.

            <h1>Factors influencing Happiness</h1>
            <h3>"Normal" Factors</h3>
            <p>
                The report examines several factors believed to influence happiness. These represent the actual, 
                observed data points without transformation 
            </p>
            <p><strong>GDP per capita:</strong> Economic performance of a country</p>
            <p><strong>Social support</strong> Having someone to count on in difficult times</p>
            <p><strong>Healthy life expectancy:</strong> Expected years of good health</p>
            <p><strong>Freedom to make life choices:</strong> The level of freedom in daily life</p>
            <p><strong>Generosity</strong> Measures of giving within a society</p>
            <p><strong>Perceptions of Corruption</strong> Widespread corruption believed in the country</p>
            <p><strong>"Explained by"</strong> refers to the factors that instead of raw values, they explain the variation in happiness 
                scores between countries. Compare Australia/Malaysia against the top/bottom 5 happiest countries

            <h1>Final Remarks</h1>
            <h3>Most important Factors</h3>
            <p>
                From analysing the data above, the most important factors of happiness scores of countries 
                are <strong>GDP per capita</strong> and <strong>Social support</strong>. Higher wealth in countries also suggest positive correlations
                in other factors such as life expectancy and social support. 
            </p>
                Although it can provide vital information for governments to help countries further develop their infrastructure, 
                one must remember that correlation does not imply causation.
            <p>

            </p>
            <h3>Geogrophy</h3>
            <p>
                The highest scorers are located in <strong>Europe</strong> and <strong>Oceania</strong>. This is because these countries are more developed with 
                their respective governments providing more support for their citizens and their existing infrastructure. 
                However, these are not to be taken literally as happiness is still subjective but it is a good indicator
            </p>
            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>
                The most spoken languages in the world are Mandarin, Spanish, and English. However, the countries that 
                speak these languages do not necessarily have the highest happiness scores. This is because happiness 
                is not only influenced by language, but also by geography, culture, and other factors. 
                Although English is one of the most spoken languages, this does not have that much of a global correlation.
                We see that European countires that speak <strong>German</strong> and <strong>French</strong> have higher happiness scores.
