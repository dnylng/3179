            <p>On the left is a scatterplot which compares the happiness level with many other factors which influence it</p>
            <p>On the bottom is a pie chart which shows the happiness and its explained by factors, please be aware that all the values 
                in the explained by do not neccessarily add up to the happiness score because the factors just show how much it affects the 
                happiness score, not the actual happiness score itself.
            </p>
            <p>From the data we can see the GDP and life expectancy are the most important factors when it comes to the world happiness
                level but it is not the do all or end all.

                are the happiest countries. This is consistent with the data in the boxplots as they show that European countries
                are on average the happiest countries with barely any outliers
